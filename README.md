# Nessus Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview
This project demonstrates my experience using the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner to assess the security of various systems. Nessus was used to identify vulnerabilities and recommend mitigation strategies. Below, I provide an overview of the scanning process, vulnerability findings, and steps taken to mitigate risks.

## Tools Used
- **Nessus Vulnerability Scanner**
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Database/System Scanned:** Local Windows machine

## Project Goals
- Perform comprehensive vulnerability scanning on a network.
- Identify critical, high, medium, and low vulnerabilities.
- Propose actionable mitigation steps based on Nessus reports.

## Process

1. **Setup Nessus Scanner:**
   - Installed Tenable Nessus on Windows machine.
   - Installed necessary plugins
   - Configured Nessus to scan local host network 
   
2. **Running a Scan:**
   - Scanned the target systems using the default scan profile.
   - Adjusted scanning preferences for specific environments (e.g., authenticated scans, custom policies).

3. **Results and Analysis:**
   Nessus identified vulnerabilities categorized primarily as medium and informational, with no critical or high-severity vulnerabilities present.
The top vulnerabilities identified include SMB Signing Not Required, SSL/TLS misconfigurations, and various service detection issues, such as unpatched SMB and HTTP vulnerabilities.
Several issues were identified with SSH and MySQL services, which, if left exposed, could potentially be exploited by attackers performing reconnaissance or SQL injection attacks.

 Vulnerabilities Identified:
1 Medium
26 Informational
The vulnerabilities include issues related to SMB Signing not required, SSL/TLS misconfigurations, and multiple service detection issues involving outdated protocols and services.
   
5. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   Based on the results of the scan, the following mitigation steps are proposed to reduce the risk posed by the identified vulnerabilities:
Patch Management: Apply patches and updates for critical and medium vulnerabilities, such as those related to SMB Signing, SSL/TLS misconfigurations, and HTTP vulnerabilities. Regularly update all software to mitigate the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited.
Secure Configuration:
Close unused ports, particularly those related to port scanners and unused services, to minimize the attack surface.
Disable weak protocols like SSLv3 and older versions of TLS, ensuring only strong, modern cryptographic standards are in use.
Enforce SMB signing across the network to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
Network Segmentation: Isolate vulnerable or sensitive systems, such as databases and HTTP servers, into separate network segments with restricted access. This will limit the exposure of critical systems to potential attackers.
Access Control Enhancements: Implement strong access control mechanisms, particularly for SSH and MySQL services, to prevent unauthorized access. Restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses and use key-based authentication.
Monitoring and Auditing: Continuously monitor network activity for suspicious behavior, such as unauthorized port scanning attempts or unusual traffic patterns, and review security logs regularly.
These steps will not only address the vulnerabilities detected by Nessus but also strengthen the overall security posture of the environment, mitigating potential risks from future attacks.

Mitigation for SMB Signing Not Required Vulnerability
The SMB Signing Not Required vulnerability, as shown in the screenshot, is a medium severity issue identified by Nessus. This vulnerability occurs when Server Message Block (SMB) signing is not enforced on the server, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to intercept and modify SMB communications between a client and a server. This leaves the system vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, which can compromise data integrity.

Mitigation Steps:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you need to enforce SMB signing on all SMB communications. SMB signing ensures that all SMB traffic is cryptographically signed, preventing unauthorized tampering during transit.

For Windows Systems:

Configure the group policy setting titled "Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)" to enabled. This forces SMB signing on all communications, securing the SMB server from MITM attacks.
Apply this policy across all Windows servers that use SMB.

7. **Lessons Learned:**
 It is essential to do regular vulnerability assessments to find potential attack routes, out-of-date software, and configuration flaws in your system. You can lower the chance of exploitation by finding vulnerabilities early on in your network by regularly scanning it. The Nessus scan in this instance found multiple critical vulnerabilities, such as SSL/TLS misconfigurations and missing SMB signature, which, if ignored, might have seriously compromised the system's security. Frequent evaluations guarantee that these hazards are identified and promptly reduced.  Since not all vulnerabilities are equally dangerous, effective risk management must rank mitigation actions according to their possible consequences. Deciding which vulnerabilities to resolve first can be aided by using factors like exploitability, business context, and the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System). For example, vulnerabilities like SMB Signing Not Required, although categorized as medium, offer a large risk owing to the possibility of MITM attacks, making it a high-priority remedy. Conversely, while still significant, less serious informational vulnerabilities might wait until more pressing problems have been resolved before being addressed. Strategic prioritizing guarantees effective resource allocation by concentrating on the most significant risks initially.
